We propose a probabilistic model that bridges graph machine learning and sum-product networks to tractably answer probabilistic queries. Our Graph-induced Sum-Product Network can solve unsupervised and supervised graph tasks and it is especially effective in modeling the missing data distribution as well as exploiting unlabeled data in a scarce supervision scenario.
