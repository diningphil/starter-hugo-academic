Our paper ["A deep graph network-enhanced sampling approach to efficiently explore the space of reduced representations of proteins"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2021.637396/abstract) has been accepted for publication in Frontiers Molecular Biosciences. Together with the [Potestio Lab](https://twitter.com/r_potestio?lang=en), we trained a deep graph networks to approximate a complex measure of information retention in proteins after a coarse-graining process is applied. PDF available soon!
