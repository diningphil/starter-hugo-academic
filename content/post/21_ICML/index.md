Wonderful news! Our paper "Graph Mixture Density Networks" has been accepted at ICML 2021! Shout out to my supervisors [Alessio Micheli](http://pages.di.unipi.it/micheli/) and [Davide Bacciu](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bacciu/) that made this possible. We study the problem of learning multi-modal output distributions conditioned on arbitrary input graphs. With GMDN, we can predict if there's more than one likely outcome associated with an input graph: this is especially useful, for example, when predicting the final outcome of a pandemic when the social network is known. We will release the camera ready very soon!
