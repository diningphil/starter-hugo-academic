We officially released the 0.5.0 version of our [PyDGN](https://github.com/diningphil/PyDGN) library! We have added a bunch of useful features, refactored the code, and fixed some bugs! Special thanks to [Danilo Numeroso](http://pages.di.unipi.it/numeroso/) who implemented a very useful and flexible random search technique!
