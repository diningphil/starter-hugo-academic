Together with [Antonio Carta](http://pages.di.unipi.it/carta/), [Andrea Cossu](https://andreacossu.github.io/), and [Davide Bacciu](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bacciu/), our paper "Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Graph Networks: an Introductory Benchmark for Graph Classification" has been accepted for publication at the [WWW'21 Workshop on Graph Learning Benchmarks](https://graph-learning-benchmarks.github.io/). We study whether known continual learning techniques have an impact when applied to graphs, but we also observe that structure-preserving regularization may help. Also, a structure-agnostic baseline shows strong performances in this scenario [(again)](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_HygDF6NFPB.html), indicating that there is much to be done at the intersection of the Continual Learning and Graph Representation Learning fields!
EDIT: it has also been selected as one of the two orals of the workshop! Great news :)
