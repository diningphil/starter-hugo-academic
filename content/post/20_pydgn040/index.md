We officially released the 0.4.0 version of our PyDGN library! In the past few months the library has become more mature, and I summarized its main features in this short {{< staticref "media/PyDGNv0_4_0-intro-slides.pdf" "newtab" >}}presentation{{< /staticref >}}. Version 0.4.0 features the addition of the Ray library to handle multiprocessing as well as distributed computing! To make an example, you can run parallel experiments on your local laptop, on different GPUs at the same time or even on a cluster of machines! Special thanks to [Antonio Carta](http://pages.di.unipi.it/carta/) who made a wonderful porting of Ray into PyDGN! Nowâ€¦back to research! :)
